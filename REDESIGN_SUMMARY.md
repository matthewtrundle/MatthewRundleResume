## Design Philosophy

This redesign follows executive hiring best practices:
- **6-second rule**: Key info visible immediately
- **Metrics-first**: Numbers that matter upfront
- **Social proof**: Testimonials and achievements
- **Professional**: Clean, trustworthy design
- **Action-oriented**: Clear CTAs throughout

The new design positions you as an executive who happens to be technical, not a technical person trying to be strategic.

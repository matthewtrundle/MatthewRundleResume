## Script Option 1: "The Strategic Pivot"

**[0:00-0:15] Hook - The Why**
"After driving $200 million in impact at Expedia Group through analytics transformation, I saw something most executives miss: AI isn't just another tool—it's a fundamental shift in how we solve business problems."

**[0:15-0:35] The Journey**
"So I made a strategic decision. I stepped away from my senior management role to master AI implementation hands-on. Over 18 months, I've built production AI systems—from enterprise data assistants to multi-agent architectures—because I believe the best AI leaders don't just manage; they build."

**[0:35-0:55] Unique Value**
"I bring something rare to the table: proven enterprise leadership—managing 100+ person teams and P&L responsibility—combined with real technical depth. I've architected and deployed AI solutions that are in production today, serving real users, solving real problems."

**[0:55-1:15] Vision Forward**
"Organizations need leaders who can bridge the gap between AI's technical possibilities and business realities. Someone who can speak to the board about ROI and sit with engineers to debug model performance. That's exactly what I offer."

**[1:15-1:30] Call to Action**
"If you're looking for an AI leader who combines strategic vision with hands-on expertise, let's talk about how I can help transform your organization's AI ambitions into measurable business impact."

## Script Option 2: "The Builder Executive"

**[0:00-0:15] Hook - Show, Don't Tell**
"This enterprise data assistant behind me? I built it. The AI-powered social media platform? I architected it. After leading $200 million in transformation at Expedia, I'm now building the AI future."

**[0:15-0:35] The Transformation**
"I spent a decade mastering enterprise analytics, leading global teams, and driving strategic initiatives. But when I recognized AI's transformative potential, I didn't just read about it—I dove in. 500+ hours of hands-on development. Real systems. Real impact."

**[0:35-0:55] What I Bring**
"I'm not your typical AI hire. I combine the strategic thinking of a senior executive with the technical skills of an AI engineer. I've managed 100+ person teams AND written production Python code. I've presented to C-suites AND deployed machine learning models."

**[0:55-1:15] The Opportunity**
"Today's organizations don't need more AI theory—they need leaders who can implement. Who understand both the boardroom and the codebase. Who can translate between data scientists and executives."

**[1:15-1:30] Let's Connect**
"Ready to accelerate your AI transformation with a leader who's actually built what others only strategize about? Let's explore how my unique blend of enterprise leadership and technical expertise can drive your success."

## Script Option 3: "The AI Implementation Expert"

**[0:00-0:15] Direct Opening**
"I'm Matthew Rundle. Former Senior Manager at Expedia. Led $200 million in impact. Now I build AI systems that transform businesses."

**[0:15-0:35] The Pivot Story**
"Eighteen months ago, I made a calculated bet. I left my executive role to master AI implementation—not because I had to, but because I saw the future. Since then, I've built enterprise data assistants, multi-agent systems, and AI-powered platforms that are in production today."

**[0:35-0:55] Differentiation**
"Here's what makes me different: I've sat in the C-suite, managed P&Ls, and led global transformations. But I've also written the code, trained the models, and deployed the systems. I don't just strategize about AI—I implement it."

**[0:55-1:15] Value Proposition**
"Your organization needs AI leaders who can navigate both worlds—who can secure executive buy-in AND architect scalable solutions. Who understand ROI AND model accuracy. Who can lead teams AND build systems."

**[1:15-1:30] Close**
"If you're serious about AI transformation and need a leader who combines enterprise experience with hands-on expertise, let's connect. I'm ready to help you turn AI potential into business reality."

## Key Delivery Tips:

1. **Background**: Professional but not corporate sterile. Consider showing one of your AI projects on screen behind you.

2. **Wardrobe**: Business casual—shows you're professional but hands-on.

3. **Energy**: Confident and conversational, not salesy. You're sharing your story, not pitching.

4. **B-Roll Options**: 
   - Quick screen recordings of your AI projects
   - Whiteboard with architecture diagrams
   - You typing/working (shows hands-on nature)

5. **Avoid**:
   - Apologizing for the career pivot
   - Over-explaining technical details
   - Sounding like you're "learning" vs. "mastering"

Choose the script that feels most authentic to you. The key is to own your unique position: an executive who builds.
